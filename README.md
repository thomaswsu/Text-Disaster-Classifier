# Text-Disaster-Classifier
This is a project that I did with The Center for Infrastructure, Transportation, and the Environment (CITE) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). This is code creates multiple binary classifiers using various methods. Allowing a user to identify whether a given text is related to a disaster or not. Using a data that was provided by CITE to me, I was able to reach 95+% accuracy with certain methods. Some code is edited out to protect the data. More information can be provided upon request.
